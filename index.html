    <p> I am currently learning to code with
      <a href= "https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/" target="_blank">Code First Girls.</a>
      Going over everything from how the
      internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
    Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...

    <ol>
      <li>You can understand what is going on 'under the hood'</li>
      <li>Not have to reply on someone else fro a quick prototype website</li>
      <li>It's fun!!!</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>
      <i>What do you need to create a website?</i>
    </h2>

      Not very much!

   <ul>

      <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
      <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
      <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
      <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>

  </ul>
